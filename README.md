# Geometry-Program
Created a Python program featuring two classes, Hexagon and Square, to analyze geometric shapes. Utilizes the last digit of the user's CNIC for dimension input. The user interacts via a menu:

Hexagon:

Calculates and displays area, perimeter, and sum of angles.

Square:

Computes and showcases area and perimeter.

User Interaction:

Continuous menu loop for personalized geometric insights.

Implementation:

User-friendly, employing consistent function names.
ðŸš€ Result:
An engaging program for exploring hexagons and squares based on user-provided CNIC data! ðŸ’¡ðŸ’» #Python #Geometry #CodingFun #Mathematics
